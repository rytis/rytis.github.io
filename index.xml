      <title>Quick Way to Check for Url Redirects</title>

      <description>Recently I had to go through a bunch of URLs and identify whether or not they redirect to another URL. Since the list was rather long (several hundred entries), I thought I should rather write a script to do this for me.
I used the Requests library to make the initial request for a given URL. If the response code was 3XX, then I assumed it is being redirected. There are a couple of other edge cases (timeouts and generic connection errors, either due to non-existent domain, or network error) that the script attempts to cover for.</description>

      <description>Couple of scenarios:
 You are connected to a publicly available WiFi network that you do not trust, but you have a trusted server somewhere where you can connect to You are connected to a network that has limited access (or no access at all as it happened in my case), but you can connect to another host that can  So, what are your options?
Obviously you can set up a VPN server on the remote machine and connect to it, but it can be a bit fiddly.</description>

      <title>Network Bonding Configuration With Foreman</title>

      <description>This post is mostly a note to self. The snippets are kindly provided by user schewara who posted them to #theforeman IRC channel. Many thanks for sharing these snippets, they have saved me a lot of time, and hopefully will be usefull for other people as well!
What I was trying to achieve is multi-NIC with bonding configuration in Foreman/Puppet.
One way is to leave this configuration entirelly to Puppet. Another way is to configure the interfaces at the kicstart phase, which is a safer option.</description>

      <title>Setting Up Foreman on RHEL 5.7 Part 2</title>

      <description>In Part 1 we installed and configured Puppet. We have also set up puppet to write host configuration data to a PostgreSQL database using storedconfig.
Today, I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you how to install and configure:
 Foreman Foreman&amp;rsquo;s smart-proxy Integrate smart-proxy with DHCP/TFTP/DNS/Puppet  Install Foreman from the latest development branch Installing Foreman from RPM has its own advantages, but currently the situation is such that the packaged (Stable) version lags quite far behind the development branch.</description>

      <title>Use Foreman Host Parameters From Fabric</title>

      <description>Fabric is great for managing remote systems. You can script whatever you want to do on a remote system, and run the tasks at any time, on any set of systems. This is an excellent automation tool, as it does not require any agent processes running on the remote systems - it uses SSH for its communication with the remote hosts.
If you are using Foreman to manage your systems, you already maintain a list of servers.</description>

      <description>In this set of articles we are going to go through the steps required to get a fully functional setup of Puppet 2.7.12 and Foreman 0.5 (git development branch) on a system running RedHat Enterprise Linux (or CentOS) version 5.7.
Before we dive in, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss why such and old version of OS is used in this example.
Why use CentOS/RHEL version 5.7 ? RHEL5 is an old product. Released on 2007-03-15 it will be going through the following life cycle dates:</description>
