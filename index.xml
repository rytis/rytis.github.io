      <description>Recently I had to go through a bunch of URLs and identify whether or not they redirect to another URL. Since the list was rather long (several hundred entries), I thought I should rather write a script to do this for me.
I used the Requests library to make the initial request for a given URL. If the response code was 3XX, then I assumed it is being redirected. There are a couple of other edge cases (timeouts and generic connection errors, either due to non-existent domain, or network error) that the script attempts to cover for.</description>

      <description>This post is mostly a note to self. The snippets are kindly provided by user schewara who posted them to #theforeman IRC channel. Many thanks for sharing these snippets, they have saved me a lot of time, and hopefully will be usefull for other people as well!
What I was trying to achieve is multi-NIC with bonding configuration in Foreman/Puppet.
One way is to leave this configuration entirelly to Puppet. Another way is to configure the interfaces at the kicstart phase, which is a safer option.</description>
